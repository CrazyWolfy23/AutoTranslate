# Auto Translate

This is a java pc application that translates decoded mcpe files into headers. This requires java to be installed, I made the project with java 1.8 (because thats the only version i have).

You can download the prebuilt version [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0qxn6bhlodrtod4/AutoTranslate.jar?dl=0).
